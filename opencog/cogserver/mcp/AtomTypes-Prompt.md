# Atom Types Reference

**Purpose:** Comprehensive reference for 170+ Atom types organized by functional category

**Status:** Complete - covers all major categories with 3-10 sentence descriptions per type

**Wiki:** https://wiki.opencog.org/w/Atom_types (detailed docs for each type)

---

## Category: Flows - Data Stream Processing

**Purpose:** Process streams of Values through transformation pipelines

### FilterLink

**Purpose:** Filters and transforms collections/streams by pattern matching. The functional programming `filter-map` for Atomese. Unlike QueryLink (which searches entire AtomSpace), FilterLink operates ONLY on the provided input collection.

**Core Concept:** FilterLink is the "opposite" of PutLink - it EXTRACTS values from patterns (un-beta-reduction) instead of substituting them in. Think of it as an adjoint functor to PutLink.

**Two Forms:**

**Form 1: Filter + Lambda (Extraction)**
```scheme
(Filter
  (Lambda <vardecls> <pattern>)
  <input-collection>)
```
- Variables in pattern ARE the extraction points
- Pattern matches input elements
- Returns VALUES that matched the variables
- No separate rewrite - the variables themselves are what you get

**Form 2: Filter + Rule (Extraction + Transformation)**
```scheme
(Filter
  (Rule <vardecls> <pattern> <rewrite>)
  <input-collection>)
```
- Three-part structure: variables, pattern to match, rewrite template
- Pattern matches input, rewrite transforms matches
- Returns rewritten results
- Equivalent to Filter+Lambda followed by PutLink

**Input Types:** Single Atom, SetLink, ListLink, LinkValue, QueueValue

**Output Preserves Input Type:**
- SetLink input → SetLink output (unordered)
- ListLink input → ListLink output (ordered preserved)
- LinkValue input → LinkValue output
- Single Atom input → matched value or empty

**Type Filtering:** Automatic - elements not matching TypedVariable constraints are silently discarded (this IS the filtering behavior).

**Examples:**

*Single Variable Extraction:*
```scheme
(Filter
  (Lambda
    (Variable "$x")
    (Evaluation (Predicate "foo")
      (List (Concept "bar") (Variable "$x"))))
  (Evaluation (Predicate "foo")
    (List (Concept "bar") (Concept "baz"))))
; Returns: (Concept "baz")
; The variable $x matched "baz", so we get "baz"
```

*Extract from Set (multiple matches):*
```scheme
(Filter
  (Lambda
    (Variable "$x")
    (Evaluation (Predicate "foo")
      (List (Concept "bar") (Variable "$x"))))
  (Set
    (Evaluation (Predicate "foo") (List (Concept "bar") (Number 3)))
    (Evaluation (Predicate "foo") (List (Concept "bar") (Concept "one")))
    (Evaluation (Predicate "foo") (List (Concept "bar") (Concept "two")))))
; Returns: (SetLink (Number 3) (Concept "one") (Concept "two"))
; All three $x matches extracted, wrapped in SetLink (input was Set)
```

*Type Filtering:*
```scheme
(Filter
  (Lambda
    (TypedVariable (Variable "$x") (Type 'ConceptNode))
    (Evaluation (Predicate "foo")
      (List (Concept "bar") (Variable "$x"))))
  (Set
    (Evaluation (Predicate "foo") (List (Concept "bar") (Concept "one")))
    (Evaluation (Predicate "foo") (List (Concept "bar") (Number 3)))))
; Returns: (SetLink (Concept "one"))
; Number filtered out - doesn't match ConceptNode type
```

*Multi-Variable Extraction:*
```scheme
(Filter
  (Lambda
    (VariableList
      (TypedVariable (Variable "$x") (Type 'ConceptNode))
      (TypedVariable (Variable "$y") (Type 'ConceptNode)))
    (Evaluation (Predicate "foo")
      (List (Variable "$x") (Variable "$y"))))
  (Set
    (Evaluation (Predicate "foo") (List (Concept "bar") (Concept "one")))
    (Evaluation (Predicate "foo") (List (Concept "bar") (Concept "two")))))
; Returns: (SetLink
;            (ListLink (Concept "bar") (Concept "one"))
;            (ListLink (Concept "bar") (Concept "two")))
; Each match returns ListLink of variable values in declaration order
```

*Rule Form - Transformation:*
```scheme
(Filter
  (Rule
    (VariableList
      (TypedVariable (Variable "$x") (Type 'ConceptNode))
      (TypedVariable (Variable "$y") (Type 'ConceptNode)))
    ; Pattern
    (Evaluation (Predicate "foo")
      (List (Variable "$x") (Variable "$y")))
    ; Rewrite - swap order
    (Evaluation (Predicate "reverse-foo")
      (List (Variable "$y") (Variable "$x"))))
  (Set
    (Evaluation (Predicate "foo") (List (Concept "bar") (Concept "one")))))
; Returns: (SetLink
;            (EvaluationLink (Predicate "reverse-foo")
;              (ListLink (Concept "one") (Concept "bar"))))
; Pattern matched, rewrite applied - order swapped
```

**Usage in Pipelines:** Chain Filters directly for efficiency. Don't store intermediate results with SetValue between stages.

**Critical Details:**
- Empty result if no matches (not error)
- Type constraints filter automatically
- Multi-variable returns ListLink per match (to track which var is which)
- SignatureLink can constrain whole structure, not just node types

**See:** `/pattern-matcher/examples/filter.scm` (comprehensive examples)

### ValueOfLink

**Purpose:** Retrieves and optionally EXECUTES a Value stored on an Atom. The "read" side of the key-value database.

**Format:**
```scheme
(ValueOf <atom> <key>)
```

**Two Behaviors (automatic):**
1. If Value at key is NOT executable → returns the Value as-is
2. If Value IS executable → EXECUTES it and returns result

**This Dual Nature is Critical for Pipelines:**
- Store an executable Atom (Filter, parser, formula) at a key
- ValueOfLink retrieves it AND runs it
- Perfect for lazy evaluation and stream processing

**Example - Simple Retrieval:**
```scheme
; Store a FloatValue
(cog-set-value! (Concept "foo") (Predicate "data") (FloatValue 1 2 3))

; Retrieve it
(cog-execute! (ValueOf (Concept "foo") (Predicate "data")))
; Returns: (FloatValue 1 2 3)
```

**Example - Execution:**
```scheme
; Store an executable computation
(cog-execute!
  (SetValue (Concept "foo") (Predicate "compute")
    (DontExec (Plus (Number 2) (Number 3)))))

; ValueOf retrieves AND executes
(cog-execute! (ValueOf (Concept "foo") (Predicate "compute")))
; Returns: (Number 5)  ← Plus was executed
```

**Pipeline Pattern - Anchor References:**
```scheme
; Store filter pipeline at anchor
(cog-execute!
  (SetValue (Anchor "pipeline") (Predicate "stage1")
    (DontExec
      (Filter <rule> <source>))))

; Reference retrieves AND executes filter
(define stage1-output
  (ValueOf (Anchor "pipeline") (Predicate "stage1")))

; Each cog-execute! on stage1-output runs the filter
(cog-execute! stage1-output)  ; Processes one stream element
```

**Not for Scheme-side Retrieval:** If you just want to read a Value from Scheme without execution, use `(cog-value atom key)`, NOT ValueOfLink.

**Convention:** Use PredicateNodes as keys. Standard message names: `*-open-*`, `*-close-*`, `*-read-*`, `*-write-*`, `*-stream-*`

**See Also:** SetValueLink (stores Values), DontExecLink (prevents immediate execution)

---

### SetValueLink

**Purpose:** Stores a Value on an Atom at a key. The "write" side of the key-value database. Executes as SIDE EFFECT.

**Format:**
```scheme
(SetValue <atom> <key> <value>)
```
**Three-argument form** (most common)

**Alternative Format:**
```scheme
(SetValue <atom> <key> <procedure> <arguments>)
```
**Four-argument form** for calling procedures

**Behavior:**
1. Evaluates third argument (if executable)
2. Stores result at key on atom
3. Returns the Value that was stored (for chaining)

**Example - Simple Storage:**
```scheme
(cog-execute!
  (SetValue (Concept "foo") (Predicate "data")
    (FloatValue 1 2 3)))
; Stores FloatValue, returns (FloatValue 1 2 3)
```

**Example - Compute Then Store:**
```scheme
(cog-execute!
  (SetValue (Concept "result") (Predicate "sum")
    (Plus (Number 5) (Number 3))))
; Executes Plus, stores (Number 8), returns (Number 8)
```

**Example - Copy Value:**
```scheme
; Copy from foo to bar
(cog-execute!
  (SetValue (Concept "bar") (Predicate "data")
    (ValueOf (Concept "foo") (Predicate "data"))))
; ValueOf retrieves from foo, SetValue stores to bar
```

**Example - Procedure Call (4-arg form):**
```scheme
(cog-execute!
  (SetValue (Concept "result") (Predicate "computed")
    (DefinedProcedure "triangle-numbers")
    (List (Number 5))))
; Calls procedure with argument, stores result
```

**Pipeline Pattern - Store DontExec:**
```scheme
; Store executable pipeline WITHOUT running it
(cog-execute!
  (SetValue (Anchor "pipeline") (Predicate "parser")
    (DontExec
      (Filter
        (Rule ...)
        text-stream))))
; Filter is stored, not executed. Later ValueOf will execute it.
```

**Mutability:** Values CAN change even though Atoms are immutable. The Atom stays the same, but Values attached to it can be updated.

**Thread Safety:** Atomic for single operations. Use IncrementValueLink or GrantLink for complex thread-safe updates.

**Returns:** The Value that was stored (allows chaining SetValue calls)

**See Also:** ValueOfLink (retrieves), DontExecLink (stores without executing), IncrementValueLink (thread-safe math)

---

### DontExecLink

**Purpose:** Prevents immediate execution of executable Atoms. "Quote for execution" - stores the recipe, not the result.

**Format:**
```scheme
(DontExec <executable-atom>)
```

**Why This Exists:**
- SetValueLink executes its third argument before storing
- But sometimes you want to STORE the executable itself, not run it
- DontExec wraps the executable to prevent evaluation
- Later, ValueOfLink unwraps and THEN executes

**Example - Without DontExec (executes immediately):**
```scheme
(cog-execute!
  (SetValue (Anchor "test") (Predicate "data")
    (Plus (Number 2) (Number 3))))
; Plus executes NOW, stores (Number 5)
; You stored the RESULT, not the computation
```

**Example - With DontExec (stores computation):**
```scheme
(cog-execute!
  (SetValue (Anchor "test") (Predicate "compute")
    (DontExec (Plus (Number 2) (Number 3)))))
; Plus NOT executed, stored as PlusLink
; Value at key is the PlusLink itself

; Later, ValueOf retrieves and executes
(cog-execute! (ValueOf (Anchor "test") (Predicate "compute")))
; NOW Plus executes, returns (Number 5)
```

**Pipeline Setup Pattern:**
```scheme
; Setup: store entire filter pipeline
(cog-execute!
  (SetValue (Anchor "pipeline") (Predicate "stage1")
    (DontExec
      (Filter
        (Rule
          (Variable "$x")
          (Variable "$x")
          (LgParseBonds (Variable "$x") (LgDict "en") (Number 4)))
        text-source))))

; Usage: reference executes the filter
(define parse-stage
  (ValueOf (Anchor "pipeline") (Predicate "stage1")))

; Each call processes one element through pipeline
(cog-execute! parse-stage)
```

**Not Like QuoteLink:** QuoteLink prevents pattern matching. DontExec prevents execution. Different purposes.

**Returns:** The wrapped executable (unchanged)

**Critical for:** Pipeline setup, lazy evaluation, storing procedures for later

**See Also:** SetValueLink (uses DontExec), ValueOfLink (unwraps and executes), QuoteLink (prevents pattern matching)

### IncrementValueLink
Atomically increments a numeric Value, providing thread-safe counting and accumulation. Takes an Atom, key, and optional increment amount (defaults to 1). If no Value exists at key, creates FloatValue starting at increment amount. Vector Values are incremented component-wise. Thread-safe via internal locking, allowing concurrent updates without corruption. Commonly used for statistics, event counting, and parallel processing. Returns the new Value after increment. Much faster than read-modify-write in application code.

### DontExecLink
Prevents immediate execution of an executable Atom, storing it for later evaluation. Used when you want to store a "recipe" rather than execute it now. Critical for pipeline setup: `(SetValue anchor key (DontExec (Filter ...)))` stores the Filter without running it. Later, `(ValueOf anchor key)` retrieves and executes it. Without DontExec, executable Atoms would run during SetValue. Also called "quoting for execution" - like QuoteLink but for executable Atoms. Returns the wrapped Atom unchanged.

### AnchorNode
Named reference point for storing stream sources and pipeline stages. By convention, uses Predicates as keys: `(SetValue (Anchor "pipeline") (Predicate "stage1") source)`. Enables pipeline organization: each stage stores its output on an Anchor, next stage reads via ValueOfLink. Not special - just a Node type, but conventionally used for this purpose. Helps debugging by naming pipeline components. Multiple pipelines can coexist using different Anchor names. Cleaner than threading stream objects through code.

## Category: Streams - AtomSpace to Data Conversion

**Purpose:** Extract data from AtomSpace and convert to stream format

### StringOfLink

**Purpose:** Type conversion between Nodes and StringValues, and between different Node types. Critical bridge between streaming Values and concrete Atoms.

**Core Problem Solved:** Atomese has no "naked strings" - you cannot directly place string literals into Link patterns. StringOfLink bridges this gap by converting between:
- Node types (e.g., Word → Concept)
- Nodes ↔ StringValues (stream data ↔ AtomSpace storage)

**Three Primary Conversion Patterns:**

**1. Node → Node Conversion (Type Transformation)**
```scheme
(StringOf (Type 'ConceptNode) (Word "cat"))
; Extracts "cat" from WordNode, creates (ConceptNode "cat")
; This is THE critical operation for Link Grammar semantic extraction
```

**2. StringValue → Node (Stream to Storage)**
```scheme
(StringOf (Type 'ConceptNode) (ValueOf (Anchor "x") (Predicate "key")))
; If anchor holds (StringValue "hello"), creates (ConceptNode "hello")
; AtomSpace acts as "sink" - flow stops, freezes into Nodes
```

**3. Node → StringValue (Storage to Stream)**
```scheme
(StringOf (Type 'StringValue) (Concept "hello"))
; Creates (StringValue "hello") from ConceptNode
; AtomSpace acts as "source" - Nodes flow out as Values
```

**Syntax:**
```scheme
(StringOf <target-type> <source>)
```
Where:
- `<target-type>`: Either `(Type 'SomeNode)` or `(Type 'StringValue)`
- `<source>`: Node, StringValue, Variable, or expression producing one

**Usage in Patterns (FilterLink):**

StringOfLink can encode StringValue literals in patterns (since Values can't appear directly):
```scheme
(Filter
  (Rule
    (Variable "$filename")
    ; Match pattern - StringOf creates StringValue from Node name
    (LinkSignature (Type 'LinkValue)
      (Variable "$filename")
      (StringOf (Type 'StringValue) (Node "reg")))  ; Matches StringValue "reg"
    (Variable "$filename"))
  stream)
```

**Usage in Rewrites (Stream Processing):**

Common pattern: Convert streaming StringValues into tagged Nodes:
```scheme
(Filter
  (Rule
    (Variable "$strv")
    (Variable "$strv")
    ; Rewrite: Convert to ConceptNode and tag
    (Edge (Predicate "sentence word")
      (StringOf (Type 'Concept)
        (ValueOf (Variable "$strv")))))
  string-stream)
```
Result: Stream data becomes queryable Nodes in AtomSpace.

**"Sink" vs "Source" Semantics:**

- **AtomSpace as Sink:** Streaming data (StringValues) flows in, StringOfLink converts to Nodes, data "freezes" into permanent storage
- **AtomSpace as Source:** Nodes flow out, StringOfLink converts to StringValues for streaming to external systems

**Common Use Cases:**

1. **Link Grammar Processing:** Convert `(Word "runs")` → `(Concept "runs")` for semantic graphs
2. **Chat/Web Interfaces:** Capture streaming text as Nodes for storage/memory
3. **File Processing:** Convert file paths from StringValues to ItemNodes with metadata
4. **Knowledge Integration:** Stream data in, query AtomSpace later without re-accessing source

**Key Properties:**

- Executable via `cog-execute!`
- Pure type conversion - no string manipulation
- Name preservation - only type changes
- Works with Variables in patterns
- Can chain with ValueOf to process stored Values

**Critical for:** Semantic extraction pipelines (Word → Concept), stream-to-storage workflows, external system integration.

### NumberOfLink
Converts FloatValue to NumberNode by extracting the first component of the vector. FloatValue `[3.14, 2.71]` becomes `(Number "3.14")`. Only uses first element, discards rest. Commonly used after arithmetic operations that return FloatValues when you need a Node in the AtomSpace. Executable via cog-execute!. Counterpart to numeric operations which often return Values. Returns a Node, not a Value.

### CollectionOfLink
Converts between Atoms and Values, primarily LinkValue ↔ SetLink/ListLink. Without type argument, defaults to SetLink. Can specify: `(CollectionOf (Type 'ListLink) linkvalue-source)`. Takes a stream of individual Values/Atoms and bundles them into a Link. Used when FilterLink or other stream operations produce LinkValue but you need actual Atoms in AtomSpace. Type-preserving: respects ordered vs unordered. Inverse operation: can convert SetLink to LinkValue for stream processing. Essential bridge between Value-based pipelines and Atom-based queries.

### SizeOfLink
Returns length of a Value or collection as FloatValue `[n]`. Works on: FloatValue → vector length, StringValue → vector length, LinkValue → number of elements, Atoms with outgoing sets → outgoing set size, NumberNode → 1. Returns single-element FloatValue for easy use in arithmetic. Executable. Common use: check how many items in stream before processing. Also works on Nodes (returns `[1]`) and Links (counts outgoing). Fast operation.

### IncomingOfLink
Retrieves the incoming set of an Atom as a LinkValue containing all Links that reference it. Non-executable - meant for use with FilterLink or other stream processors. The incoming set is unordered, so LinkValue order is arbitrary. Returns empty LinkValue if no incoming Links. Essential for graph traversal: find all relationships involving an entity. Example: `(IncomingOf (Concept "cat"))` returns LinkValue of all Links containing that Concept. Use with FilterLink to process each incoming Link.

### TypeOfLink
Returns the type of an Atom as a TypeNode. Example: `(cog-execute! (TypeOf (Concept "foo")))` → `(Type "ConceptNode")`. Executable. Used in meta-programming and dynamic dispatch: examine atom type to choose processing path. Returns the actual runtime type, not base type. Works with all Atoms. Simple but essential for type introspection.

### KeysOfLink
Returns all keys attached to an Atom as a LinkValue. These are the keys in the Atom's key-value database. Non-executable - use with FilterLink to process. Returns LinkValue of Atoms (usually PredicateNodes). Empty LinkValue if no keys. Essential for discovering what data is attached to an Atom. Use case: find all properties of an entity. Order is arbitrary.

### IsKeyLink
Checks if a specific key exists on an Atom, returns TrueLink or FalseLink. Format: `(IsKey atom key-atom)`. Executable. Used in conditional pipelines to check if data exists before processing. More efficient than fetching all keys. Returns boolean Atom, not Value.

## Category: Link Grammar - Natural Language Parsing

**Purpose:** Parse natural language text using Link Grammar parser

### LgParseBonds

**Purpose:** Modern Link Grammar parser - returns bond (link) structures as pure data (LinkValue). Does NOT pollute AtomSpace with parse results.

**Format:**
```scheme
(LgParseBonds
  (Phrase "sentence text")
  (LgDict "language")        ; "en" for English, "ru" for Russian, etc.
  (Number num-linkages))     ; How many parses to return (4 is common)
```

**Return Structure:** NESTED LinkValues (this is critical to understand):

```
LinkValue [                              ← Outer: one element per linkage
  LinkValue [                            ← Linkage 1
    LinkValue [word1, word2, word3, ...] ← Word-list (all words in sentence)
    LinkValue [bond1, bond2, bond3, ...] ← Bond-list (grammatical links)
  ]
  LinkValue [                            ← Linkage 2 (alternate parse)
    LinkValue [word1, word2, word3, ...]
    LinkValue [bond1, bond2, ...]
  ]
  ...                                    ← Up to num-linkages parses
]
```

**Word-list:** LinkValue of Word nodes
- Example: `LinkValue [(Word "Phase") (Word "2") (Word "implements") ...]`
- Word order matches sentence order
- Each word appears once even if used in multiple bonds

**Bond-list:** LinkValue of Edge atoms showing grammatical relationships
- Each bond: `(Edge (Bond "type") (List (Word "word1") (Word "word2")))`
- Bond type examples: "Ss*s" (singular subject), "Os" (object), "MVp" (verb modifier)
- Bonds connect words by grammatical role

**Example Output for "Phase 2 implements processing":**
```scheme
LinkValue [
  LinkValue [
    LinkValue [(Word "Phase") (Word "2") (Word "implements") (Word "processing")]
    LinkValue [
      (Edge (Bond "Ss*s") (List (Word "Phase") (Word "implements")))
      (Edge (Bond "Os") (List (Word "implements") (Word "processing")))
      (Edge (Bond "AN") (List (Word "2") (Word "Phase")))
      ...
    ]
  ]
]
```

**Multiple Linkages:** If you request 4 parses, outer LinkValue has 4 elements (different interpretations). Parser returns up to N, may return fewer if sentence is unambiguous.

**Processing Pattern with FlatStream:**
```scheme
; Parser returns 4 linkages bundled together
(define parse-result (LgParseBonds (Phrase "text") (LgDict "en") (Number 4)))

; Unbundle them with FlatStream so you process one linkage at a time
(define flattened
  (LinkSignature (Type 'LinkValue)
    (Promise (Type 'FlatStream) parse-result)))
; Now each cog-execute! on flattened returns ONE linkage: [words, bonds]
```

**Extracting Bonds from Linkage:**
```scheme
(Filter
  (Rule
    (VariableList
      (TypedVariable (Variable "$words") (Type 'LinkValue))
      (TypedVariable (Variable "$bonds") (Type 'LinkValue)))
    ; Pattern: linkage is two-element LinkValue
    (LinkSignature (TypeInh 'LinkValue)
      (Variable "$words")
      (Variable "$bonds"))
    ; Rewrite: keep only bonds
    (Variable "$bonds"))
  linkage-stream)
```

**Finding Specific Bond with Glob:**
```scheme
(Filter
  (Rule
    (VariableList
      (TypedVariable (Variable "$words") (Type 'LinkValue))
      (Glob "$before")                    ; Bonds before target
      (TypedVariable (Variable "$subj") (Type 'Word))
      (TypedVariable (Variable "$verb") (Type 'Word))
      (Glob "$after"))                    ; Bonds after target
    ; Pattern: find Ss*s bond anywhere in bond-list
    (LinkSignature (Type 'LinkValue)
      (Variable "$words")                 ; First element: word-list
      (LinkSignature (Type 'LinkValue)    ; Second element: bond-list
        (Glob "$before")                  ; Match bonds before
        (Edge (Bond "Ss*s")               ; The bond we want
          (List (Variable "$subj") (Variable "$verb")))
        (Glob "$after")))                 ; Match bonds after
    ; Rewrite: return subject-verb pair
    (LinkSignature (Type 'LinkValue)
      (Variable "$subj")
      (Variable "$verb")))
  parse-stream)
```

**Common Bond Types:**
- **Ss*s** - Singular subject to singular verb
- **Os** - Object (verb to object)
- **MVp** - Past tense verb modifier
- **AN** - Adjective/number to noun
- **Ds** - Determiner to noun
- Hundreds more - see Link Grammar documentation

**Why Two Elements (words + bonds)?** Parser may tokenize differently or choose different word forms (spell-checker). Word-list shows actual words used in THIS parse. Usually identical across linkages but not guaranteed.

**Executable:** Use `cog-execute!` or MCP `execute` tool

**See:** `/sensory/examples/parse-pipeline.scm` (complete pipeline), `/diary/lg_learning/complete_svo_extraction.scm` (extraction patterns)

### Phrase (aka PhraseNode)
Input text for Link Grammar parser. Simply wraps a string: `(Phrase "The cat sat")`. Not the parsed result - just the input. Node type created for type safety. Use as first argument to LgParseBonds. UTF-8 text.

### LgDict (aka LgDictNode)
Specifies which Link Grammar dictionary to use. `(LgDict "en")` for English, `(LgDict "ru")` for Russian, etc. Required argument to LgParseBonds. Dictionaries must be installed separately. Dictionary determines what languages can be parsed and what link types are recognized.

### Word (aka WordNode)
Individual word in a Link Grammar parse. Created by parser, not manually. Name is the actual word: `(Word "cat")`. Appears in bond structures. Type-separate from ConceptNode intentionally - distinguishes syntax (Word) from semantics (Concept). Use StringOfLink to convert: `(StringOf (Type 'ConceptNode) (Word "cat"))` → `(Concept "cat")`.

### Bond (aka BondNode)
Link type in Link Grammar parse, like "Ss*s" (subject-verb singular), "Os" (object), "MVp" (verb-modifier past). Created by parser in Edge structures: `(Edge (Bond "Ss*s") (List word1 word2))`. Name is the Link Grammar link type. Hundreds of types, see LG documentation. Different bonds indicate different grammatical relationships. Essential for pattern matching to extract semantic relationships.

### LgParseDisjuncts, LgParseSections
Specialized parsers returning disjuncts or Section atoms instead of bonds. Disjuncts show how words connect. Sections are sheaf-theoretic structures for advanced use. Most users want LgParseBonds. These are for linguistic research or specialized processing.

## Category: Pattern Matching - Queries and Variables

**Purpose:** Core pattern matching constructs for querying AtomSpace

### MeetLink
Finds all Atoms matching a pattern, returns results as QueueValue (thread-safe stream). Format: `(Meet vardecls pattern)`. Vardecls can be Variable, TypedVariable, or VariableList. Pattern uses variables as placeholders. Returns QueueValue containing all groundings: each element is the variable binding (single Variable) or ListLink (multiple variables). Non-polluting: doesn't create Atoms in AtomSpace for results. Execute with cog-execute!. For patterns only - no rewriting. See `/pattern-matcher/examples/` for extensive examples.

### QueryLink
Pattern matching WITH rewriting: finds matches and creates new Atoms based on template. Format: `(Query vardecls pattern rewrite)`. Like MeetLink but adds third argument: rewrite template. For each match, substitutes variables in rewrite template with matched values. Returns QueueValue of rewritten Atoms. Mathematically: MeetLink + PutLink. Use when you want to transform matches, not just find them. Core tool for inference and rule application.

### RuleLink

**Purpose:** Pattern-matching rewrite rule for stream processing with FilterLink. Combines pattern matching with transformation in one atom.

**Structure:** THREE parts (not two like Lambda):
```scheme
(Rule
  <variable-declarations>    ; Part 1: VariableNode, TypedVariable, or VariableList
  <pattern-to-match>         ; Part 2: Pattern with variables
  <rewrite-template>)        ; Part 3: What to return when matched
```

**How It Works:**
1. FilterLink feeds stream elements to Rule
2. Rule tries to match pattern against each element
3. If match succeeds: variables get grounded, rewrite template executed with those values, result returned
4. If match fails: element discarded (filtered out)
5. No match = filtering, match = transformation

**Comparison to Lambda:**
- **LambdaLink:** 2 parts (vardecls + body). Body IS the pattern. Variables ARE the extraction.
- **RuleLink:** 3 parts (vardecls + pattern + rewrite). Pattern for matching, rewrite for output.
- Rule = "if pattern matches, return rewrite"
- Lambda = "extract what matches variables"

**Example - Simple Transformation:**
```scheme
(Filter
  (Rule
    (TypedVariable (Variable "$x") (Type 'StringStream))
    (Variable "$x")                    ; Pattern: match anything of type StringStream
    (LgParseBonds                      ; Rewrite: parse it
      (Variable "$x")
      (LgDict "en")
      (Number 4)))
  text-stream)
; Each string from text-stream gets parsed, returns parse results
```

**Example - Pattern + Rewrite:**
```scheme
(Filter
  (Rule
    (VariableList
      (TypedVariable (Variable "$words") (Type 'LinkValue))
      (TypedVariable (Variable "$bonds") (Type 'LinkValue)))
    ; Pattern: match LinkValue with two elements
    (LinkSignature (TypeInh 'LinkValue)
      (Variable "$words")
      (Variable "$bonds"))
    ; Rewrite: keep only bonds, discard words
    (Variable "$bonds"))
  linkage-stream)
; Extracts bond-list from [word-list, bond-list] pairs
```

**Example - Complex Pattern with Glob:**
```scheme
(Filter
  (Rule
    (VariableList
      (TypedVariable (Variable "$words") (Type 'LinkValue))
      (Glob "$before")
      (TypedVariable (Variable "$subj") (Type 'Word))
      (TypedVariable (Variable "$verb") (Type 'Word))
      (Glob "$after"))
    ; Pattern: find Ss*s bond anywhere in bond-list
    (LinkSignature (Type 'LinkValue)
      (Variable "$words")
      (LinkSignature (Type 'LinkValue)
        (Glob "$before")
        (Edge (Bond "Ss*s") (List (Variable "$subj") (Variable "$verb")))
        (Glob "$after")))
    ; Rewrite: return just subject and verb
    (LinkSignature (Type 'LinkValue)
      (Variable "$subj")
      (Variable "$verb")))
  parse-output)
; Finds Ss*s bond in parse, extracts subject-verb pair
```

**When to Use Rule vs Lambda:**
- Use **Lambda** when you just want to extract variables from pattern
- Use **Rule** when you need to transform/rewrite the match
- Rule is more powerful but more verbose

**Not for AtomSpace Queries:** Rule is for FilterLink (stream processing). For AtomSpace pattern matching use QueryLink.

**See Also:** FilterLink (uses Rules), QueryLink (AtomSpace equivalent)

### GlobNode

**Purpose:** Matches variable-length sequences of Atoms in ordered collections. The pattern-matching equivalent of regex wildcards for Atomese.

**Core Concept:** While VariableNode matches exactly one Atom, GlobNode matches zero or more consecutive Atoms in a sequence. Essential for patterns where you don't know how many elements appear between known anchors.

**Basic Syntax:**
```scheme
(Glob "$varname")
```

**Default Behavior:** Without constraints, Glob matches **one or more** Atoms (like regex `+`, not `*`). To match zero Atoms, use IntervalLink.

**Context Requirements:**
- Must appear in **ordered** collections: ListLink, LinkValue (via LinkSignature)
- Cannot appear in unordered collections: SetLink
- Binding returns a ListLink of matched Atoms (even for single match)

**Example 1 - Basic Wildcard Matching:**
```scheme
; Pattern
(ListLink (Concept "I") (Glob "$middle") (Concept "you"))

; Matches:
(ListLink (Concept "I") (Concept "love") (Concept "you"))
; $middle = (ListLink (Concept "love"))

(ListLink (Concept "I") (Concept "really") (Concept "totally") (Concept "need") (Concept "you"))
; $middle = (ListLink (Concept "really") (Concept "totally") (Concept "need"))
```

**Example 2 - Type Constraints:**

Limit Glob to specific Atom types:
```scheme
(TypedVariable (Glob "$numbers") (Type "NumberNode"))

; Pattern
(ListLink (Concept "I") (Concept "love") (Glob "$numbers"))

; Matches:
(ListLink (Concept "I") (Concept "love") (Number 42))
; $numbers = (ListLink (Number 42))

; Does NOT match:
(ListLink (Concept "I") (Concept "love") (Concept "you"))
; "you" is not a NumberNode
```

**Example 3 - Interval Constraints (Match Count):**

Control how many Atoms the Glob must match:
```scheme
; Match exactly 0 or 1 Atoms
(TypedVariable (Glob "$maybe") (IntervalLink (Number 0) (Number 1)))

; Match 0 to infinity (true regex * behavior)
(TypedVariable (Glob "$any") (IntervalLink (Number 0) (Number -1)))

; Match exactly 1 (forces non-empty)
(TypedVariable (Glob "$one") (IntervalLink (Number 1) (Number 1)))

; Match 2 to 5 Atoms
(TypedVariable (Glob "$few") (IntervalLink (Number 2) (Number 5)))
```
Where: `(IntervalLink min max)` with -1 meaning infinity.

**Example 4 - Combined Type + Interval:**

Use TypeSetLink to combine both constraints:
```scheme
(TypedVariable (Glob "$concepts")
  (TypeSetLink
    (IntervalLink (Number 0) (Number -1))  ; 0 to infinity
    (Type "ConceptNode")))                 ; Only ConceptNodes

; Matches any number of ConceptNodes (including zero)
```

**Example 5 - Multiple Globs in One Pattern:**
```scheme
(QueryLink
  (VariableList
    (TypedVariable (Glob "$before") (IntervalLink (Number 0) (Number -1)))
    (TypedVariable (Glob "$verb")
      (TypeSetLink (Type "ConceptNode") (IntervalLink (Number 1) (Number 1))))
    (TypedVariable (Glob "$after") (IntervalLink (Number 0) (Number -1))))
  (ListLink
    (Glob "$before")
    (Concept "I")
    (Glob "$verb")
    (Concept "you")
    (Glob "$after"))
  ...)
; Finds any verb between "I" and "you" with optional words before/after
```

**Example 6 - LinkValue Processing (Link Grammar):**

Critical for bond extraction where position is unknown:
```scheme
(Filter
  (Rule
    (VariableList
      (TypedVariable (Variable "$words") (Type 'LinkValue))
      (Glob "$before")
      (TypedVariable (Variable "$subj") (Type 'Word))
      (TypedVariable (Variable "$verb") (Type 'Word))
      (Glob "$after"))
    ; Pattern: Find Ss bond anywhere in bond list
    (LinkSignature (Type 'LinkValue)
      (Variable "$words")
      (LinkSignature (Type 'LinkValue)
        (Glob "$before")
        (Edge (Bond "Ss*s") (List (Variable "$subj") (Variable "$verb")))
        (Glob "$after")))
    ; Rewrite: Extract just subject and verb
    (LinkSignature (Type 'LinkValue) (Variable "$subj") (Variable "$verb")))
  parse-output)
```
This finds the Ss bond regardless of position in the bond list.

**Key Behavior Details:**

1. **Greedy Matching:** When multiple Globs appear, matcher tries to satisfy constraints but behavior depends on context
2. **Type Filtering:** Type constraints apply to EACH matched Atom - all must satisfy the type
3. **Empty Matches:** Return empty ListLink when Glob matches zero Atoms (if interval allows)
4. **QueryLink vs FilterLink:** Works in both, but FilterLink more common for stream processing

**Common Patterns:**

- **Prefix match:** `(Glob "$rest")` at end
- **Suffix match:** `(Glob "$rest")` at start
- **Infix extraction:** `(Glob "$before") <target> (Glob "$after")`
- **Optional elements:** IntervalLink (0, 1) for maybe-present items
- **Unbounded wildcard:** IntervalLink (0, -1) for true regex `*`

**Critical for:** Link Grammar bond extraction, flexible list patterns, natural language processing, sequence matching with unknown lengths.

### VariableNode
Pattern variable for matching single Atoms. Format: `(Variable "$name")`. Dollar-sign convention but not required. In pattern, acts as placeholder: `(Edge (Predicate "rel") (List (Variable "$x") (Concept "target")))` matches any first element. Grounding is the matched Atom. Use TypedVariable to constrain type. Distinguished from regular Nodes by context (pattern matching) not type alone.

### TypedVariableLink
Constrains pattern variable to specific type(s). Format: `(TypedVariable (Variable "$x") (Type 'ConceptNode))`. Variable `$x` will only match ConceptNodes. Type can be base type (matches all subtypes) or use TypeChoice for alternatives. Essential for reducing search space and preventing nonsensical matches. Works with VariableNode and GlobNode. Enables type-safe pattern matching.

### VariableList
Declares multiple variables for pattern. Format: `(VariableList (Variable "$x") (Variable "$y") ...)`. Can mix Variable and TypedVariable. Order doesn't matter for matching but affects result structure: MeetLink returns ListLink in declaration order. Alternative to listing variables separately. Required when pattern has multiple variables.

### SignatureLink
Type pattern for matching Atom structure. Uses TypeNodes instead of Variables. Format: `(Signature (Type 'EdgeLink) (Type 'PredicateNode) (Type 'ListLink))`. Matches any Edge with Predicate and List children. More rigid than Variables - only checks types, doesn't bind values. Used with FilterLink for type-based filtering. Polymorphic via TypeChoice. Different from LinkSignature (which constructs LinkValues).

### LinkSignature (aka LinkSignatureLink)

**Purpose:** Has TWO different uses depending on context - this is confusing but critical to understand!

---

**USE 1: In Rewrite Clauses - CONSTRUCTS LinkValue**

When used in the rewrite part of a Rule (or as executable), LinkSignature BUILDS a new LinkValue from its arguments.

**Format:**
```scheme
(LinkSignature (Type 'LinkValue) elem1 elem2 elem3 ...)
```

**Example - Constructing Output:**
```scheme
(Filter
  (Rule
    (VariableList
      (Variable "$subj")
      (Variable "$verb"))
    <pattern>
    ; REWRITE: construct new LinkValue with two elements
    (LinkSignature (Type 'LinkValue)
      (Variable "$subj")
      (Variable "$verb")))
  input)
; Returns LinkValue containing subject and verb
```

**Type Inheritance Variant:**
```scheme
(LinkSignature (TypeInh 'LinkValue) ...)  ; Matches LinkValue and subtypes
```

**Nesting:**
```scheme
; Construct nested LinkValue structure
(LinkSignature (Type 'LinkValue)
  (Variable "$outer")
  (LinkSignature (Type 'LinkValue)  ; Inner LinkValue
    (Variable "$inner1")
    (Variable "$inner2")))
```

---

**USE 2: In Pattern Clauses - MATCHES LinkValue Structure**

When used in the pattern part of a Rule, LinkSignature specifies structure to match by checking types and positions.

**Format:**
```scheme
(LinkSignature (Type 'LinkValue)
  <type-or-variable-1>
  <type-or-variable-2>
  ...)
```

**Example - Matching Structure:**
```scheme
(Filter
  (Rule
    (VariableList
      (TypedVariable (Variable "$words") (Type 'LinkValue))
      (TypedVariable (Variable "$bonds") (Type 'LinkValue)))
    ; PATTERN: match LinkValue with exactly 2 elements of specified types
    (LinkSignature (TypeInh 'LinkValue)
      (Variable "$words")   ; First element (any LinkValue)
      (Variable "$bonds"))  ; Second element (any LinkValue)
    <rewrite>)
  input)
; Matches LinkValue with two LinkValue elements, binds them to variables
```

**Example - Nested Pattern:**
```scheme
(Rule
  (VariableList
    (TypedVariable (Variable "$words") (Type 'LinkValue))
    (Glob "$before")
    (TypedVariable (Variable "$subject") (Type 'Word))
    (TypedVariable (Variable "$verb") (Type 'Word))
    (Glob "$after"))
  ; PATTERN: match nested LinkValue structure
  (LinkSignature (Type 'LinkValue)
    (Variable "$words")                    ; Outer first element
    (LinkSignature (Type 'LinkValue)      ; Outer second element - also LinkValue
      (Glob "$before")                    ; Inner: variable-length prefix
      (Edge (Bond "Ss*s")                 ; Inner: specific bond
        (List (Variable "$subject") (Variable "$verb")))
      (Glob "$after")))                   ; Inner: variable-length suffix
  <rewrite>)
; Matches LgParseBonds output: [words, [bonds with Ss*s somewhere]]
```

---

**Key Differences:**

**In Patterns (matching):**
- Checks that input HAS specified structure
- Variables BIND to elements at those positions
- Type constraints filter mismatches
- Globs match variable-length sequences

**In Rewrites (constructing):**
- CREATES new LinkValue from arguments
- Variables are SUBSTITUTED with their grounded values
- Result is actual LinkValue data structure
- No matching - pure construction

**Common Pattern: Match → Extract → Reconstruct:**
```scheme
(Rule
  <vardecls>
  ; Match structure
  (LinkSignature (Type 'LinkValue) pattern...)
  ; Reconstruct different structure
  (LinkSignature (Type 'LinkValue) rewrite...))
```

**Type vs TypeInh:**
- `(Type 'LinkValue)` - Match exactly LinkValue type
- `(TypeInh 'LinkValue)` - Match LinkValue or any subtype (type inheritance)
- Use TypeInh when you want flexible matching

**Critical for:** Processing LgParseBonds output, any nested LinkValue manipulation, stream transformations

**See Also:** RuleLink (uses LinkSignature), LgParseBonds (produces nested LinkValues)

## Category: Scoping & Lambda Calculus

**Purpose:** Variable binding, lambda expressions, beta reduction

### LambdaLink
Lambda abstraction for creating anonymous functions. Format: `(Lambda vardecls body)`. Vardecls specify parameters, body is expression using those variables. When executed with PutLink, performs beta reduction: substitutes arguments for variables. Used to define DefinedProcedureNode and DefinedSchemaNode bodies. Unlike ScopeLink (change of variable only), LambdaLink allows free beta-reduction with any values. Example: `(Lambda (Variable "$x") (Plus (Variable "$x") (Number 1)))` is increment function. Execute via PutLink to apply.

### PutLink
Beta reduction: substitutes values for variables in a lambda expression or pattern. Format: `(Put lambda-or-pattern (List arg1 arg2 ...))` or `(Put vardecls body (List args))`. Creates new Atom/Value with variables replaced by arguments. Core of function application in Atomese. QueryLink = MeetLink + PutLink conceptually. Can explicitly specify variables as ScopeLink. Returns the result of substitution. Example: `(Put (Lambda (Variable "$x") (Plus (Variable "$x") (Number 1))) (List (Number 5)))` → `(Number 6)`.

### ScopeLink
Base class for links with scoped variables (LambdaLink, QueryLink, MeetLink, etc.). Provides variable scoping infrastructure. Not typically used directly - use subclasses. Defines variable scope boundaries. Only allows beta-reductions equivalent to change-of-variable (alpha conversion), unlike LambdaLink's free reduction. Ensures variable names don't clash. Foundation for all variable-using Atoms.

### JoinLink
Pattern matching for partial graphs: finds containing structures when given subgraphs. Dual to MeetLink. While MeetLink finds subgraphs matching a pattern, JoinLink finds "super-graphs" containing known elements. Format: `(Join vardecls pattern)`. Searches for unknown containers of known subgraphs. Named for lattice theory "join" operation (MeetLink is "meet"). Less commonly used than MeetLink but powerful for structural queries. Returns QueueValue of matching containers.

### DualLink
Inverse pattern matching: given a ground term (answer), finds patterns (questions) that would match it. Used for pattern recognition and rule engine construction. Finds all queries/rules that this data satisfies. Essential for SRAI/chatbot systems: match input to response patterns. Also useful for finding applicable rules in forward chaining. Given concrete data, returns patterns with variables that would match. Enables meta-reasoning: "what rules apply here?"

### FreeLink
Marks variables as free (not to be bound) in a pattern. Normally all variables in scope are bound; FreeLink prevents binding specific ones. Used when you want some variables to remain as variables in result. Format: `(Free (Variable "$x") body)`. Variable `$x` stays as `$x` instead of being grounded. Rare use case but essential when needed.

### QuoteLink, UnquoteLink
Prevents pattern matching/execution within quoted region. QuoteLink treats contents literally - variables aren't variables, executable Links aren't executed. UnquoteLink escapes back to normal interpretation within quoted region. Similar to Lisp quote/unquote. Used when you want to match the structure of a pattern itself, not use it as a pattern. LocalQuoteLink is variant for local quoting.

---

## Category: Arithmetic & Numeric Functions

**Purpose:** Symbolic and computational arithmetic

### PlusLink
Addition operation, both symbolic and computational. Format: `(Plus arg1 arg2 ...)`. Works on NumberNodes, FloatValues, returns appropriate type. Performs term reduction: `0 + x → x`, `2 + 3 → 5`, `x + x → 2*x`. Vector addition component-wise. Symbolic: represents formula in AtomSpace for learning/reasoning. Computational: actually computes when executed. Built on FoldLink for associative reduction. Fast but not CPU-native speed (100x slower than raw CPU).

### TimesLink
Multiplication with symbolic manipulation and computation. Format: `(Times arg1 arg2 ...)`. Reductions: `1 * x → x`, `0 * x → 0`, `2 * 3 → 6`. Component-wise for vectors. Can multiply matrices via vector operations. Accumulate sums components; Times multiplies them. Also built on FoldLink. Used extensively in formula representation for PLN, learning systems.

### MinusLink
Subtraction: `(Minus arg1 arg2)`. Binary operation. Performs reductions: `x - 0 → x`, `x - x → 0`, `5 - 3 → 2`. Vector subtraction component-wise. Less commonly used than Plus (can use Plus with negative numbers).

### DivideLink
Division: `(Divide numerator denominator)`. Binary operation. Reductions: `x / 1 → x`, `0 / x → 0`, `6 / 2 → 3`. Component-wise for vectors. Beware division by zero - may throw or return NaN depending on context.

### AccumulateLink
Sums all components of a vector FloatValue. `FloatValue [1, 2, 3]` → `FloatValue [6]`. Reduces vector to single number. Essential for vector processing pipelines. Different from PlusLink which adds multiple vectors component-wise. Common pattern: arithmetic on vectors → AccumulateLink → NumberOfLink → Node.

### FoldLink
Generic associative reduction operation over lists. PlusLink and TimesLink built on top of this. Implements comp-sci fold/reduce concept. Takes binary operation and list, applies operation iteratively. Most users use PlusLink/TimesLink rather than FoldLink directly. Foundation for iterated operations.

### GreaterThanLink, LessThanLink, EqualLink
Comparison operations returning TrueLink or FalseLink. Virtual links - don't store all possible comparisons, compute on demand. Example: `(GreaterThan (Number 5) (Number 3))` → TrueLink. Work with NumberNodes and FloatValues. Essential for conditional logic. Used in pattern matching as evaluatable conditions. GreaterThan and others allow reasoning about order without computing all combinations.

### ExpLink, LogLink, SineLink, CosineLink, TanLink, PowLink
Mathematical functions for scientific computation. All executable. ExpLink is e^x, LogLink is natural log, trig functions self-explanatory. PowLink is exponentiation: `(Pow base exponent)`. Work on NumberNodes and FloatValues. Used in formulas for PLN, statistics, signal processing. Combined with arithmetic for complex expressions.

### MinLink, MaxLink
Return minimum/maximum of arguments. `(Min arg1 arg2 ...)` returns smallest. Works on numbers and vectors (component-wise). Used in optimization, bounds checking. Executable.

### FloorLink, HeavisideLink, ImpulseLink
Specialized math functions. FloorLink rounds down. HeavisideLink is step function (0 below threshold, 1 above). ImpulseLink is delta function. Used in signal processing and piecewise functions.

### RandomNumberLink
Generates random number when executed. Returns FloatValue. Non-deterministic - each execution gives different result. Seed not controllable via Atomese (uses system random). Used for probabilistic algorithms.

---

## Category: Boolean Logic & Conditions

**Purpose:** Logical operations and conditional execution

### AndLink, OrLink, NotLink
Classical boolean logic on TrueLink/FalseLink. AndLink: all arguments must be True. OrLink: any argument can be True. NotLink: inverts single argument. Executable - evaluate boolean sub-expressions. Used in pattern matching conditions and conditional execution. Different from SequentialAndLink (which sequences actions).

### TrueLink, FalseLink
Boolean constants. No arguments, just represent True/False. Returned by comparisons and predicates. Used as success/failure indicators. Execute to themselves.

### SequentialAndLink, SequentialOrLink
Execute arguments in order, short-circuit on failure/success. SequentialAnd stops at first failure. SequentialOr stops at first success. Unlike AndLink/OrLink which are declarative, these are imperative control flow. Used for sequencing actions where order matters. Returns last executed value.

### ChoiceLink
Try alternatives in order until one succeeds. Format: `(Choice option1 option2 ...)`. Executes options sequentially, returns first non-failing result. Used for fallback logic. Pattern matching: try multiple patterns. Different from OrLink which evaluates all.

### PresentLink
Tests if pattern exists in AtomSpace, returns TrueLink/FalseLink. Like SatisfactionLink but returns boolean. Used in conditional logic: "if this pattern exists, then...". Evaluatable in queries. Finds at least one grounding of pattern. Non-polluting check for existence.

### AbsentLink
Negation: pattern must NOT exist. Returns TrueLink if pattern not found. Implements intuitionistic logic - represents "unknown" not "known false". Variables in Absent leak to outer scope. Essential for negative constraints: "find X that is NOT Y". Used with And to combine positive and negative conditions. See `/pattern-matcher/examples/absent.scm`.

### AlwaysLink
Universal quantifier: pattern must hold for ALL instances. "For-all" semantics. Different from pattern matching's default "there-exists". Tests that condition holds universally. Returns TrueLink if all instances satisfy, FalseLink otherwise. Used for global constraints.

### GroupLink
Groups results by shared variable values, like SQL GROUP BY. Returns nested structure: outer level groups, inner level group members. Used when you want to cluster results. Example: group people by city. Less common than other pattern atoms but powerful for aggregation.

---

## Category: External Systems - Callbacks & Integration

**Purpose:** Call external code (Python, Scheme, C++) from Atomese

### GroundedSchemaNode
Calls external code when executed. Format: `(GroundedSchema "lang:function")`. Language prefixes: `py:` for Python, `scm:` for Scheme, `lib:` for C++ shared libraries. Function must be in PYTHONPATH/load-path. Used with ExecutionOutputLink to pass arguments. Returns Value. Example: `(GroundedSchema "py:my_function")` calls Python function `my_function`. Essential bridge to external processing, sensors, actuators. Allows Atomese to control external systems.

### GroundedPredicateNode
External predicate returning boolean (TrueLink/FalseLink). Format: `(GroundedPredicate "lang:function")`. Used in pattern matching to check external conditions. Example: sensor reading above threshold. Function receives arguments, returns boolean. Enables reactive behavior: patterns trigger only when external condition holds. Used in robotics, game AI, chatbots for environmental awareness.

### DefinedSchemaNode
Named Atomese function defined via DefineLink. Pure Atomese (no external code). Format: Define a name, then reference it. Example: `(Define (DefinedSchema "increment") (Lambda ...))`. Reusable functions in Atomese. Cleaner than copying lambdas everywhere. Can be recursive. Preferred over Grounded when logic can be expressed in Atomese.

### DefinedProcedureNode
Like DefinedSchema but for procedures (side effects OK). Named via DefineLink. Returns general Values, not just specific types. Used for complex Atomese procedures that modify state or produce varied outputs. Distinction from Schema is historical/semantic - both work similarly.

### DefinedPredicateNode
Named boolean predicate in pure Atomese. Defined via DefineLink with boolean-returning body. Used in pattern matching like GroundedPredicate but implemented in Atomese. Reusable logical conditions.

### ExecutionOutputLink
Executes Schema/Procedure with arguments. Format: `(ExecutionOutput schema (List arg1 arg2 ...))`. Schema can be Grounded* or Defined*. Passes arguments to function/procedure, returns result. Execute with cog-execute!. Essential for actually calling external code or defined functions. Arguments available to external function as list of Atoms.

### SchemaNode, ProcedureNode
Base classes. SchemaNode for functions, ProcedureNode for procedures. Not usually instantiated directly - use Grounded* or Defined* subtypes. Provide type hierarchy for callable entities.

---

## Category: Storage & Persistence

**Purpose:** Save/load AtomSpace to disk, network, databases

### StorageNode
Base class for all persistence backends. Provides store/fetch/load operations. Not used directly - use specific subtypes. Enables AtomSpace persistence and distribution. Load brings Atoms from storage into RAM. Store writes Atoms from RAM to storage. Fetch retrieves specific Atoms. All operations preserve uniqueness.

### RocksStorageNode
RocksDB backend - recommended for local persistence. Format: `(RocksStorage "rocks:///path/to/db")`. Fast, embedded database. Stores Atoms and Values. Good for single-machine persistence. No network overhead. Handles millions of Atoms efficiently. Use for checkpointing, long-term storage.

### FileStorageNode
Plain text file storage in s-expression format. Human-readable. Format: `(FileStorage "file:///path/to/file.scm")`. Slow but debuggable. Good for small AtomSpaces, configuration, sharing. Not for large datasets.

### MonoStorageNode
Single-file compact format. Fast loading. Format: `(MonoStorage "mono:///path/to/file")`. Optimized for bulk load/store. Less flexible than Rocks but faster for checkpoint/restore.

### CogStorageNode, CogSimpleStorageNode
Network client to remote CogServer. Format: `(CogStorage "cog://hostname:port")`. Enables distributed AtomSpace. Multiple clients can connect to same server. CogSimple is lightweight version. Used for multi-machine setups, cloud deployments. Atoms fetched on demand over network.

### ProxyNode
Composite/proxy pattern for multiple backends. Base class for various proxy types. Enables mirroring, load balancing, caching strategies. Wraps multiple StorageNodes.

### ReadThruProxyNode, WriteThruProxyNode, ReadWriteProxyNode
Caching proxies. ReadThru: read from storage, cache in RAM. WriteTh

ru: write immediately to storage. ReadWrite: both. Used to optimize storage access patterns. Reduces network/disk latency.

### WriteBufferProxyNode
Batches writes to reduce I/O. Accumulates changes, flushes periodically. Improves performance when many small updates. Trade-off: delayed persistence for throughput.

### SequentialReadProxyNode
Reads from multiple storages in sequence until found. Enables fallback chains. Try local cache, then remote server, then archive.

### NullProxyNode, CachingProxyNode, DynamicDataProxyNode
Specialized proxies. Null discards data (testing). Caching adds caching layer. DynamicData for generated/computed data.

### FetchValueOfLink, StoreValueOfLink
Fetch/store specific Values from storage. Like ValueOfLink but for persistence. Fetch loads from remote/disk. Store saves immediately. Granular control over what gets persisted.

---

## Category: Execution Control & State

**Purpose:** Control flow, state management, threading

### CondLink
Conditional execution (if-then-else). Format: `(Cond condition then-clause else-clause)`. Evaluates condition (boolean or pattern), executes appropriate branch. Returns result of executed branch. Used for branching logic. Condition can be comparison, PresentLink, GroundedPredicate, etc.

### StateLink
Unique state: ensures only one value for a key. Format: `(State key value)`. When new State created with same key, old one removed. Thread-safe. Used for singleton state like "current mode", "active user". Differs from SetValue (which allows multiple values per key in key-value database). StateLink is in the graph, SetValue is attached data.

### DefineLink
Names an Atom for reuse. Format: `(Define name-atom body)`. Name is usually DefinedPredicate/Schema/Procedure. Body is the definition. Enables named functions, predicates, patterns. Once defined, use name to reference body. Can be redefined (replaces previous).

### DeleteLink
Removes Atom from AtomSpace. Format: `(Delete atom)` or `(Delete atom recursive-flag)`. Immediate removal. Recursive deletes all incoming Links too. Use carefully - breaks references. Returns deleted Atom.

### UniqueLink
Creates unique instance even if duplicate structure. Overrides normal uniqueness constraint. Rarely needed. Used when you need multiple "identical" Atoms distinguished by instance.

### SequenceLink
Executes arguments in order, returns last result. Format: `(Sequence step1 step2 ...)`. Pure sequencing - all steps execute regardless. Different from SequentialAnd (short-circuit). Used for ordered side effects.

### ParallelLink
Creates threads, executes arguments in parallel. Format: `(Parallel task1 task2 ...)`. Each argument runs in new thread. Returns ListLink of results (order matches argument order). Blocks until all complete. Thread-safe - AtomSpace handles locking. Use for CPU-bound parallel work.

### ExecuteThreadedLink
Older parallel execution. ParallelLink preferred. Similar functionality.

### SleepLink
Delays execution. Format: `(Sleep (Number seconds))`. Blocks for specified time. Returns after delay. Used for timing, rate limiting. Seconds can be fractional.

### RandomChoiceLink
Randomly selects one argument to execute. Format: `(RandomChoice option1 option2 ...)`. Equal probability (currently). Returns result of chosen option. Non-deterministic. Used for stochastic behavior.

### GrantLink
Thread-safe state update with locking. More sophisticated than StateLink. Prevents race conditions in complex updates.

---

##  Category: Type System

**Purpose:** Runtime type system, type constructors, signatures

### TypeNode
References an Atom type by name. Format: `(Type 'ConceptNode')` or `(Type "ConceptNode")`. Used in TypedVariable, type patterns, type checking. Not the type itself - a reference to it. Enables meta-programming on types. Can get supertypes/subtypes dynamically.

### TypeChoice
Union type: accepts any of several types. Format: `(TypeChoice (Type 'ConceptNode) (Type 'PredicateNode'))`. Used in TypedVariable for polymorphism. Variable can match any listed type. Enables flexible patterns.

### DefinedTypeNode
User-defined type name. Created via DefineLink. Allows custom type aliases. Less common than TypeNode.

### SignatureLink
Type signature for pattern matching (already covered in Pattern section - here for completeness). Declares expected structure using types.

### ArrowLink
Function type: input types → output type. Format: `(Arrow input-types output-type)`. Describes function signatures. Used in type checking and inference. Enables typed lambda calculus.

### TypeIntersectionLink
Intersection of types: must satisfy all. Less common than TypeChoice. Used for multi-constraint type specifications.

### TypeInheritanceLink (TypeInhNode, TypeCoInhNode)
Type inheritance relationships. Rarely used directly - type hierarchy built into C++ classes. TypeInhNode checks if subtype, TypeCoInhNode for covariance. Advanced type theory features.

### TypedAtomLink
Associates type signature with an Atom. Meta-type information. Used in type inference systems.

### IntervalLink
Numeric range type. Specifies min/max bounds. Used for bounded numeric types. Type constructor for intervals.

---

## Category: NLP - Natural Language Processing

**Purpose:** Represent linguistic structures and parse results

### WordNode
Represents a word in text. Name is the word itself: `(Word "cat")`. Used in NLP processing to track vocabulary. Different from Word (Link Grammar) which is parser output. WordNode is general-purpose word representation. Used in language learning, semantic graphs. Can have linguistic properties attached via Values.

### SentenceNode
Anchor for sentence parses and linguistic analysis. One SentenceNode per sentence. ParseNodes link to SentenceNode via ParseLink to show different parses of same sentence. Name typically identifies sentence uniquely. Used to group all parse interpretations together.

### ParseNode
Represents a specific parse of a sentence. Links to SentenceNode via ParseLink. Multiple ParseNodes can exist for one SentenceNode (different interpretations). Contains or references parse tree structure. Used in ambiguity resolution, parse ranking.

### DocumentNode
Represents a document or text collection. Can contain multiple sentences. Used to group related content. Name identifies document. Enables document-level analysis and processing.

### WordInstanceNode
Unique instance of word occurrence in a parse. Same word appearing twice gets two WordInstanceNodes with unique names (e.g., "cat@123", "cat@456"). Needed because pattern matching requires unique atoms for each occurrence. Links to WordNode to show which word it instantiates.

### WordInstanceLink
Connects WordInstanceNode to its WordNode. Shows this instance is of that word type. Used to resolve instances back to word types.

### ReferenceLink
Links words/concepts to their referents or definitions. Used in coreference resolution, entity linking. Shows what a word refers to in context.

### SentenceLink
Associates sentence structure. May link parse to sentence. Various NLP relationships at sentence level.

### SequenceLink, WordSequenceLink, SentenceSequenceLink, DocumentSequenceLink
Ordered sequences of linguistic elements. WordSequence for word order. SentenceSequence for sentence order in paragraph. DocumentSequence for document order. Preserve ordering critical for language processing. Used in n-grams, context windows, text generation.

### WordClassNode
Class or category of words (e.g., "nouns", "animals"). Used for word type classification. Groups words with similar properties. Enables class-based operations.

## Category: Sensory I/O - External System Interaction

**Purpose:** Interface with files, terminals, network, external data (requires sensory module)

### SensoryNode
Base class for sensory-motor objects that interact with external systems. Subclass of ObjectNode. Implements message-passing interface with open/close/read/write messages. Foundation for all I/O atom types. Not instantiated directly - use specialized subtypes.

### TextFileNode, TextStreamNode
File I/O for text data. TextFile reads from files on disk. Format: `(TextFile "file:///path/to/file.txt")`. Supports streaming modes: read entire file, tail mode (like `tail -f`), or line-by-line. Open with `*-open-*` message, read with `*-read-*` or `*-stream-*`. TextStream is more general stream abstraction. Returns StringValue or stream of lines. Essential for file-based pipelines.

### FileSysNode
Filesystem navigator and monitor. Can watch directories with inotify for file changes. List directory contents. Monitor file creation/deletion. Format: `(FileSys "file:///path/to/dir")`. Streams filesystem events as they occur. Used for reactive systems that respond to file changes. Returns stream of ItemNodes (filenames).

### TerminalNode
Interactive terminal I/O via xterm or similar. Bidirectional: read from terminal, write to terminal. Format: `(Terminal "xterm:display")`. Opens xterm window, captures input, displays output. Used for interactive agents, debugging, demos. Reads return StringValues, writes display text. See `xterm-io.scm` example.

### IRChatNode (or IrcNode)
IRC chat client interface. Connect to IRC servers, join channels, send/receive messages. Format: `(IRC "irc://server:port/channel")`. Streams incoming messages, sends outgoing. Used for chatbots, monitoring, communication agents. Messages as StringValues with metadata. See `irc-api.scm`, `irc-echo-bot.scm` examples.

### StreamNode
Base class for streaming data sources. Provides stream interface. Subclassed by specific stream types. Not used directly.

### ObjectNode
Base class for message-passing objects representing external entities or systems. Every ObjectNode has key-value database where specific keys are interpreted as messages (methods). Getting/setting message keys invokes behavior. Convention: `*-open-*`, `*-close-*`, `*-read-*`, `*-write-*` as standard messages. Subclass to create new external interfaces. Essential pattern for extensibility.

## Category: Graph Representation - Knowledge Graphs

**Purpose:** Basic graph database structures for knowledge

### ConceptNode
Represents a concept or entity in knowledge base. Name is concept identifier: `(Concept "cat")`, `(Concept "animal")`. Most common Node type. Used in semantic networks, ontologies, knowledge graphs. Can have properties via Values, relationships via Links. Foundation of knowledge representation.

### PredicateNode
Represents a relation, property, or predicate. Name is predicate identifier: `(Predicate "has-color")`, `(Predicate "larger-than")`. Used in EdgeLink to label relationships. Also used as keys in key-value databases by convention. Distinguishes relationships from entities.

### ItemNode
Generic item or vertex in graph. More neutral than Concept. Used when item isn't really a concept - just a graph node. Filenames, identifiers, arbitrary vertices. Less semantic weight than Concept.

### TagNode
Tagging and categorization. Lightweight labels. Name is the tag. Used to mark or categorize other Atoms. Can create tag clouds, folksonomy structures.

### TagLink
Associates tags with atoms. Links TagNode to tagged Atom. Enables tag-based retrieval and organization.

### EdgeLink
Labeled directed edge in knowledge graph. **Canonical form:** `(Edge (Predicate "relation") (List source target))`. Predicate names the relationship. List contains endpoint vertices (usually ItemNode or ConceptNode). Can have more than 2 endpoints for n-ary relations. Modern replacement for EvaluationLink. Uses less RAM/CPU. Preferred for graph databases.

### ListLink
Ordered list of Atoms. Format: `(List atom1 atom2 ...)`. Order matters. Used everywhere: function arguments, sequences, compound structures. Fundamental building block. Immutable like all Links.

### SetLink
Unordered set of Atoms. Format: `(Set atom1 atom2 ...)`. Order doesn't matter: `(Set A B)` equals `(Set B A)`. Used for collections where order irrelevant. Note: for stream processing results, QueueValue preferred over SetLink.

### MemberLink
Set membership: element is member of set. Format: `(Member element set)`. Used in knowledge graphs for category membership. Different from contains-in-list.

### SubsetLink
Subset relation between sets. Format: `(Subset smaller-set larger-set)`. Used in taxonomies, hierarchies. All members of first are members of second.

### InheritanceLink, SimilarityLink
Inheritance and similarity relationships. InheritanceLink: `(Inheritance subtype supertype)` for is-a relationships. SimilarityLink: `(Similarity thing1 thing2)` for similarity. Used in ontologies, semantic networks. Enable reasoning about categories and analogies.

### ContextLink
Associates context with a statement or atom. Enables context-dependent truth, temporal logic. Less commonly used but powerful for modal logic.

---

## Category: Vector Operations - Matrix/GPU Processing

**Purpose:** Efficient vector and matrix operations for ML pipelines

### ElementOfLink

Returns single element as appropriate Value type. Used to unpack vectors for scalar operations. Example: `(ElementOf (Number 0) (ValueOf atom key))` gets first component.

### DecimateLink
Downsamples vector by factor. Keeps every Nth element. Format: `(Decimate (Number N) vector-value)`. Used in signal processing, data reduction. Returns smaller FloatValue.

### Column, FloatColumn, LinkColumn, SexprColumn, TransposeColumn
Column types for matrix operations and GPU processing. FloatColumn holds column of floats. LinkColumn holds column of Atoms. Used to pack data for vectorized operations. TransposeColumn transposes matrix. Enables batch processing, SIMD operations. Bridges to GPU computation. See `vector-column.scm` example.

### BoolOpLink, BoolAndLink, BoolOrLink, BoolNotLink
Boolean operations on boolean vectors (BoolValue). Component-wise AND, OR, NOT on bit vectors. Different from AndLink (scalar boolean logic). Used for bitwise operations, masks, filters on vector data.

    <rewrite>)
  <parse-source>)

; 3. Convert Word → Concept
(StringOf (Type 'ConceptNode) (Word "cat"))
```

**Process a data stream:**
```scheme

(SetValue (Anchor "pipeline") (Predicate "source")
  (DontExec <source-expression>))

; Filter/transform
(Filter
  (Rule <vardecls> <pattern> <rewrite>)
  (ValueOf (Anchor "pipeline") (Predicate "source")))
```

**Query AtomSpace:**
