WebSockets Demo
---------------
Demo of interacting with a running cogserver over WebSockets.
[***Run it by clicking here!***](https://html-preview.github.io/?url=https://github.com/opencog/cogserver/blob/master/examples/websockets/demo.html)
You must have a CogServer running somewhere. You must enter the URL
of that CogServer into the connection box.

The [***JSON test***](https://html-preview.github.io/?url=https://github.com/opencog/cogserver/blob/master/examples/websockets/demo.html)
page will send some same JSON to validate the CogServer connection,
and will display the network traffic for that connection.
