WebSockets Demo
---------------
Demo of interacting with a running cogserver over WebSockets.
Open the [demo.html](./demo.html) page in a browser, and go.
All the actual network i/o is done with the
[script.js](./script.js) javascript file.

The [json-test.html](./json-test.html) page validates the basic
JSON connection, showing the explict network traffic for a few
of the basic commands.
