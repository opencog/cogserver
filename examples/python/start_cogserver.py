"""
Example of how the cogserver can be started from python.
Once the server is started, it can be accessed via it's TCP/IP ports.
In this example, an AtomSpace will be created and some data poked into
it. Only afterwards will the cogserver be started. It could also be
done the other way around: the cogserver could have been started first;
the order does not matter.

The cogserver will use the same AtomSpace as the python shell; thus,
the Atoms created here will be visible there, and vice-versa.

Once the cogserver is running, The AtomSpace contents are available
via webspockets in JSON format. The python and scheme evaluators are
also avialbe through websockets; and all three: python, scheme and json,
are available through telnet. See the html pages in the example
directory for more.
